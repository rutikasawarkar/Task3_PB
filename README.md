# Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard

In this project, I developed an interactive Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard using Power BI to identify key factors contributing to customer attrition and provide actionable business insights. The dataset contains customer demographic details, service usage information, contract types, tenure, payment methods, and billing data.

The first step involved data cleaning and preparation, where data types were corrected, missing values were handled, and new calculated measures were created. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as Total Customers, Churned Customers, Churn Rate (%), and Average Monthly Charges were designed to give a high-level overview of customer retention and revenue performance.

The dashboard includes multiple visualizations to analyze churn behavior across different dimensions. A churn distribution chart shows the proportion of retained versus churned customers. Contract type analysis highlights that month-to-month customers have significantly higher churn compared to long-term contract users. The tenure vs churn analysis reveals that customers in their initial months are more likely to leave, emphasizing the importance of early engagement. Additionally, monthly charges vs churn analysis indicates that customers with higher monthly charges tend to churn more frequently. Service-based analysis shows that fiber optic users experience higher churn, pointing toward possible service quality or expectation gaps.

To enhance usability, interactive slicers for Contract, Internet Service, Payment Method, and Senior Citizen status were added, allowing dynamic analysis across customer segments. Overall, this dashboard enables stakeholders to make data-driven decisions by focusing on pricing optimization, contract strategy, service improvement, and early customer retention initiatives.
